# Pomodoro Timer

- The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method in which you do focused work during 25-minute intervals — known as 
  pomodoros — and take a five-minute short break or twenty-minute long break. This program will work and remind the user
   to take break and do work, managing time (short-break, long-break or work time) for the user.
