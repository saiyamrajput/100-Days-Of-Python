# ISS Overhead Notifier

- The program tracks the location of ISS and notifies the user (by sending an email) of the ISS (when the ISS is  
  crossing the sky near their latitude and longitude position) so that they can see it up in the sky.
- You will need to enter you own latitude and longitude in 'MY_LAT' & 'MY_LONG' parameters, and your own email address 
  & password in 'my_email' & 'my_password' parameters.
