# Password Manager 2.0

- The password manager 2.0 saves the website name, your email-id (or, username) and password to local file named
  'data.json' and copies the password to clipboard after generating them.
- It also displays a warning message if all the fields are not entered and a confirmation window to ask whether the
  information entered is right or wrong and press 'OK' to save the information.
- It has an additional feature too. This features allows us to check if user has saved a password for the same website
  previously or not and if yes then displays the saved information (username/email and password).
